# Cubology 

Welcome to my first ever game, in which you try to dodge obstacles and reach the end of the level. 
Each level is different and has a specific theme with a unique game mechanic 
(following the light in the darkness, dense fog, and dust storms, turrets, etc.). 
Game is targeted for Android smartphones, but 
it can also be built for PC with slight UI scaling issues that require attention.

The goal of the game is to pass all possible levels with as little tries as possible. 

Game includes a trial with only one life so... good luck :D

## Info
This is my first ever Unity game thanks to which I have learned the very basics of C# and Unity programming.
Images, 3D, 2D objects and music found in this game were acquired through Unity Asset store for free.
