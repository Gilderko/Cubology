# Cubology 

Welcome to my simple game created using Unity. Game is targeted for Android smartphones, but 
it can also be built for PC with slight UI scaling issues that require attention.

The goal of the game is to pass all possible levels with as little tries as possible. 

Game includes a trial with only one life so... good luck :D
